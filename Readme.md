### About me : https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauthamnk/

**Background:** 

All novice traders have seen the effect of high-frequency trading where the trade execution happens in a fraction of seconds. Hedge funds today are able to de-ploy their trading strategies into algorithmic bots which makes decision-based on the AI models. I plan to take these similar strategies and apply them to the world of decentralized finance. As a goal, I want to make this model/output of this project accessible to all.

##### This repo has juypter notebook which has intial explantory analysis. Two python files of the bollinger band and main  file that connects to the Alpca API to trade live based on the sratergy defined. 


##### Main file runs the stratergy that we create.And for this project I have built a Bollinger bands stratergy that send singlas to trade. The Main file also intiates the connection to Alpca broker. I am using Lumibot libraries for backtesting my data
