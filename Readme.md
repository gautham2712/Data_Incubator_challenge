### About me : https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauthamnk/

## **Background:** 

All novice traders have seen the effect of high-frequency trading where the trade execution happens in a fraction of seconds. Hedge funds today are able to de-ploy their trading strategies into algorithmic bots which makes decision-based on the AI models. I plan to take these similar strategies and apply them to the world of decentralized finance. As a goal, I want to make this model/output of this project accessible to all.

## Repo
